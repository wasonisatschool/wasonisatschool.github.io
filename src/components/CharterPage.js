                            <p>
                              The Taiwan Chapter of the International Society of Public Law (hereinafter: ICON•S) is established to create a diverse and interdisciplinary academic forum to discuss contemporary Public Law challenges, including administrative law, constitutional law, international law, and related social and political fields such as political science, political theory, jurisprudence, and political history. It will be an intergenerational working space that will include both established scholars and junior academics. It will seek to provide an academic space for scholars using diverse methodologies and coming from different legal backgrounds. It will also serve as a link between the Taiwan academia and the international forum that the Society offers. In its composition, the Chapter will promote the following principles: regional and political diversity, gender balance and academic excellence.
